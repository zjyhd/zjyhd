## Homework Band Conclusion

   It's great to work in the group with Matt, Arina, and Rin, and our great professor Rachel help us solve the technology issue first so we can start to work with html.We build the skeleton of our web, then we decided to build a turtles band. After this we use the version control of github to write band member's introduction. Since we only have 3 pictures, we put the three amazing instrument picture to the web, and then use my spa music to as an audio, but there always something wrong with this audio, so we have change one in the last secone. We also spend a lot of time to figure how to make our introduction in different paragraph, and work on the appearence of the website. Finally it is presented by Arina, she did a amazing job to match all the element with thewebsite together. We had a lot of fun in this project.
